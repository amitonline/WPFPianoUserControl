# WPFPianoUserControl
A WPF UserControl which displays a piano keyboard and uses MIDI to play sounds on an actual musical keyboard or synth.

This project is a demo of how to create a piano keyboard as a WFP UserControl. It displays a single octave keyboard and uses NAudio.Midi to play the sounds on a musical 
keyboard or a synth when the keys are pressed. The usercontrol will still work if no MIDI keyboard is connected - it will update the keyboard UI without trying to play any sounds.

This source code is a companion to the Youtube Playlist which explains how to create this User Control.
